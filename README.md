---

Your task for this deliverable is to research and implement the `Insertion Sort` Algorithm.

## Getting Started

* fork and clone this repo
* use `sort.py` for your Insertion sort implementation
* run `python3 sort.py` to check your work

## A little Background

Insertion sort is a `in place` [comparison sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_sort), of the same breed as `bubble sort` and `selection sort`. Insertion sort has a high time complexity compared to some sorts, but a low space complexity and tends to be faster on large sets. It is suitable for situations where memery is a restricted resource.

> The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list.
> Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.

## Research time!

> When learning a new algorithm, it is a good idea to do your best to understand it without immediately looking at source code. Why? It helps the learning process by working through the problem yourself. 

Always try the following when learning a new algorithm to understand it most effectively:

1. research and understand how the algorithm works
	* Searching for visualizations of the algorithm can be a _BIG HELP_
1. break the algorithm down into steps, 'rubber ducking' or talking through the algorithm aloud can be a great help
1. recreate the algorithmic steps in your physical space, for example use a deck of cards to execute each step of the alhgorithm
1. write the alogorithm out using pseudocode, try rubber ducking as you do this
1. implement the pseudocode code you wrote and test your code, try to think of edge cases that you need to test and account for
1. if something isn't working, loop back to step 1.
1. this is hard...take breaks for your mental and physical health!
